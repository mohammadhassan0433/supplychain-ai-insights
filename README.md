A beginner-friendly demo project combining Python, LLMs, and supply chain data

**Supply Chain + AI Insights: Phase 1 – Python Foundations**

Welcome to my learning-driven project where I combine **Python, data visualization, and supply chain analytics**.  
This is **Phase 1** of a multi-phase journey to build a full demo project using **LLMs, web scraping, data pipelines**, and **dashboards** — all tailored to real-world supply chain problems.


**What This Notebook Covers**

📘 `01_foundation_setup.ipynb` includes:

- 🧠 Basic Python for logistics (variables, lists, functions)
- 📊 Custom shipment dataset (suppliers, cost, delivery status)
- 🧮 Cost calculation functions
- 📈 Visualizations:
  - Bar chart: On-Time vs Late Deliveries
  - Pie chart: Regional shipment share
  - Line chart: Shipment cost trend
- 📝 Micro-notes after each block explaining:
  - What I learned
  - Why it matters in supply chain context

**Tools & Libraries**

- Python 3.13  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  


**Coming Next**

- Phase 2: Web scraping carrier sites for real-time delivery alerts  
- Phase 3: LLM (ChatGPT) for delivery note classification  
- Phase 4: Power BI or Streamlit dashboard  
- Phase 5: LinkedIn + GitHub portfolio sharing


**Why I’m Doing This**

I'm passionate about using data and AI to improve logistics efficiency and visibility. This project reflects my hands-on learning, creativity, and real-world mindset — especially for roles in **Supply Chain Analytics, Data-Driven Logistics, and AI-powered Operations**.
